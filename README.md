# Asymptotic-Analysis
## Basics of Asymptotic Analysis
Every coder probably want to write better and faster code.
How can we do that? Can we time how long it takes to run a program? Of course, you can!</br>
However, if we run the same program on a computer, cellphone, or even a smartwatch, it will take different times.

Wouldn’t it be great if we can compare algorithms regardless of the hardware where we run them? That’s what time complexity is for! But, why stop with the running time?</br>
Here comes the BIG O Notation..</br>
So, here comes the question How to calculate the TIME COMPLEXITY?</br>
### Calculating Time Complexity :</br>
In computer science, time complexity describes the number of operations a program will execute for the given size of input n.</br>
How do you get a function that gives you the rough number of operations that a CPU will execute?</br>
One idea is to analyze your code line by line and mind code inside loops. Let’s do an example to explain this point. For instance, we have a function to find the
