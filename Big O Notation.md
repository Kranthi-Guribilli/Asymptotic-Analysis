# Comparing algorithms using Big O Notation
## Big O Examples
There are many kinds of algorithms. Most of them fall into one of the eight time complexities that will explore in this chapter.<br>
Eight running time complexities you should know<br>
1. Constant time: O(1)
2. Logarithmic time: O(Log N)
3. Linear time: O(N)
4. Linearithmic time: O(N LogN)
5. Quadratic time: O(N^2)
6. Cubic time: O(N^3)
7. Exponential time: O(2^N)
8. Factorial time: O(N!)

And here is a plot with all of them
