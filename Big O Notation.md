# Comparing algorithms using Big O Notation
## Big O Examples
There are many kinds of algorithms. Most of them fall into one of the eight time complexities that will explore in this chapter.<br>
Eight running time complexities you should know<br>
1. Constant time: O(1)
2. Logarithmic time: O(Log N)
3. Linear time: O(N)
4. Linearithmic time: O(N LogN)
5. Quadratic time: O(N^2)
6. Cubic time: O(N^3)
7. Exponential time: O(2^N)
8. Factorial time: O(N!)

And here is a plot with all of them

Figure 1. CPU operations vs. Algorithm runtime as the input size grows
As you can see, O(1) and O(log n) is very scalable. However, O(n2) and worst can convert your CPU into a furnace ðŸ”¥ for massive inputs.
Let us know more about hese eight time complexities<br>
<b>1.Constant</b><br>
Represented as O(1), it means that regardless of input size , the number of executions is always the same.<br>
Let's see an example<br>
<b>Example: Finding if an array is empty or not.<br>
